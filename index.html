            <h2>KOCHI</h2>
            <p>Kochi (also known as Cochin) is a city in southwest India's coastal Kerala state.
                 It has been a port since 1341, when a flood carved out its harbor
                and opened it to Arab, Chinese and European merchants. Sites reflecting 
                those influences include  Fort Kochi, a settlement with tiled colonial bungalows
                and diverse houses of worship. Cantilevered Chinese fishing nets, typical of Kochi,
                 have been in use for centuries It is the most popular tourist destination for both 
                 domestic and international visitors to Kerala and is among the most visited tourist
                  destinations in India.As per Kerala's Tourism Department, the domestic tourist
                   footfall in the city was more than 23 million in 2017.According to the department,
                    aspects like MICE tourism, LuLu Mall, the Wonderla water theme park,
                     and the metro nature of Kochi city were the main aspects for attracting 
                     more domestic tourists</p>

                 <p>Popularly known as the Queen of Arabian Sea, the city also flaunts one of the
                    finest natural harbours of the world and was the centre of the world spice trade 
                    for many centuries. Old Kochi (presently called West Kochi), loosely refers to
                     a group of islands which comprise Willingdon Island, Fort Kochi, Mattancherry etc.
                     Kochi represents different things to different people. To many, it is an emerging
                    cosmopolitan city with bustling life in the streets, the cinema halls, the shopping malls, 
                    and the skyscrapers; the commercial capital of the state, with a style statement different 
                    from the rest of the State - whether in clothes or lifestyle. To some others, 
                    Kochi is a place with deep roots in history and its streets exude an old-world charm; a place with
                     beautiful monuments and a variety of linguistic and ethnic communities including Jews, Konkinis,
                      Gujaratis and so on. Yet another group looks at Kochi as a thriving, expanding market, 
                      providing opportunities for growth and prosperity to all who knock at her doors. 
                      In short, Kochi offers a cocktail of modernity, old-world charm and a global outlook that,
                       at the same time, facilitates continuity and change</p>
